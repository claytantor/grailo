You all laugh at me because I am different beause I laugh at you because you are all the same.
Make your life a rose that speaks silently in the language of the heart.
What a boring world it would be if we were all the same.
If your life is free of failures you are not taking enough risks.

The quickest way to end a war is to lose it.
You may forget the one with whom you have laughed but never the one with whom you have wept.
Do not try to change me because I will rebel.
Do not cry because it is over just smile because it happened.
Warning: Dates in calendar are closer than they appear.
The way to a friend's house is never long.
I know God wont give me more than I can handle. I just wish He didn't trust me so much.
The ultimate test of a relationship is to disagree but still hold hands.
A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush.
Nothing lasts forever not even your troubles.
Don't walk in front of me becauseI may not follow.
Don't walk behind me I may not lead.
Walk beside me, and be my friend.
All men think all men mortal but themselves.
Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own.
So cobwebs be quiet and dust go to sleep I am rocking my babies and babies do not keep.
